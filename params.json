  "body": "### Estra and FitEXA\r\nEstra and FitEXA are two programs for processing X-ray absorption spectroscopy data, extraction of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) signal, and EXAFS data analysis via least square refinement procedure (shell fitting). ESTRA and FitEXA propose useful options such as the analysis of the noise on the raw χ(k) data and a high flexibility in the choice of the model distribution function: harmonic, anharmonic (cumulants) and hard sphere models. The minimization routines underneath the FitEXA code allow ample choice/control of the non-linear minimization procedure and check of the correlation among the parameters.\r\nFurthe information could found [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X12002959)\r\n\r\n### Interfaces\r\nGraphical User Interface are supplied in the releases Estra_GUI and FitEXA_GUI. The two program allow to easily create and edit input files and to visualize the results of the two program\r\n\r\n##Estra_GUI\r\nEstra_GUI is composed by a main windows where all the parameter necessary to the EXAFS signal extraction. \r\n![estra_main](images/estra.jpg) \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
