  "body": "# Estra and FitEXA\r\n**Estra** and **FitEXA** are two programs for processing X-ray absorption spectroscopy data, extraction of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) signal, and EXAFS data analysis via least square refinement procedure (shell fitting). ESTRA and FitEXA propose useful options such as the analysis of the noise on the raw χ(k) data and a high flexibility in the choice of the model distribution function: harmonic, anharmonic (cumulants) and hard sphere models. The minimization routines underneath the FitEXA code allow ample choice/control of the non-linear minimization procedure and check of the correlation among the parameters.\r\nFurthe information could found [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X12002959)\r\n\r\n# Interfaces\r\nGraphical User Interface are supplied in the releases **Estra_GUI** and **FitEXA_GUI**. The two program allow to easily create and edit input files and to visualize the results of the two program. Moreover a supplementary command **EstraFitEXAlinecommand** is supplied \r\n\r\n##Estra_GUI\r\nEstra_GUI is composed by a main windows divided in two panes:the first at the right contain all the parameter necessary to the EXAFS signal extraction while the second contains the buttons that generate the different plots. To run the Estra program is sufficient to press <Enter>, plot are automatically redraw at the end of the program.\r\nfurthe information on the interface are shown in its help menu.\r\n\r\n\r\n| Command | Description |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| git status | List all new or modified files |\r\n| git diff | Show file differences that haven't been staged |\r\n|<img src=\"images/fourier.jpg\" width=\"100\"> |             ss  |\r\n\r\n                                  \r\n  \r\n<img src=\"images/estra.jpg\" width=\"200\"> <img src=\"images/exafs.jpg\" width=\"100\"> \r\n<img src=\"images/fourier.jpg\" width=\"100\"> \r\n\r\n##FitEXA_GUI\r\nFitEXA_GUI shre the same visual aspect of Estra_GUI, however due to the intrinsic complexity of EXAFS analysis the first pane is composed by a notebook of three pages: \r\n* _Shell_  contains the k and R limits of the fit and the path used to fit\r\n* _Minuit Var. et Param_ define the parameter used to perform the fit and the minimization commands using the minuit syntax\r\n* _Minuit log_  shows the 'fitexafs.log' file generated by the program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCarmelo Prestipino (@Prestipino), Carlo Meneghini (@cmeneghini), \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
